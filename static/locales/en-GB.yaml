Tooltips:
  Subscription Settings:
    Fetch Feeds from RSS: When enabled, FreeTube will use RSS instead of its default method to grab your subscription feed. RSS is faster and prevents IP blocking, but it doesn’t provide certain information like video duration, live status or posts
    Fetch Automatically: When enabled, FreeTube will automatically fetch your subscription feed on startup and when a new window is opened.
  Player Settings:
    Default Video Format: Set the formats used when a video plays. DASH formats can play higher qualities. Legacy formats are limited to a max of 360p but use less bandwidth. Audio formats are audio only streams.
    Proxy Videos Through Invidious: Will connect to Invidious to serve videos instead of making a direct connection to YouTube.
    Scroll Playback Rate Over Video Player: While the cursor is over the video, press and hold the Control key (Command Key on Mac) and scroll the mouse wheel forwards or backwards to control the playback rate. Press and hold the Control key (Command Key on Mac) and left click the mouse to quickly return to the default playback rate (1x unless it has been changed in the settings).
    Skip by Scrolling Over Video Player: Use the scroll wheel to skip through the video, MPV style.
  General Settings:
    Region for Trending: The region of trends allows you to pick which country’s trending videos you want to have displayed.
    Invidious Instance: The Invidious instance that FreeTube will connect to for API calls.
    Thumbnail Preference: All thumbnails throughout FreeTube will be replaced with a frame of the video, blurred or hidden instead of the default thumbnail.
    Fallback to Non-Preferred Backend on Failure: When your preferred API has a problem, FreeTube will automatically attempt to use your non-preferred API as a fallback method when enabled.
    Preferred API Backend: Choose the back-end that FreeTube uses to obtain data. The local API is a built-in extractor. The Invidious API requires an Invidious server to connect to.
    External Link Handling: "Choose the default behaviour when a link, which cannot be opened in FreeTube, is clicked.\nBy default FreeTube will open the clicked link in your default browser.\n"
    Open Deep Links In New Window: URLs passed to FreeTube, such as by redirect browser extensions or command line arguments, are opened in a new window.
  External Player Settings:
    External Player: Choosing an external player will display an icon, for opening the video (playlist if supported) in the external player, on the thumbnail. Warning, Invidious settings do not affect external players.
    Custom External Player Executable: By default, FreeTube will assume that the chosen external player can be found via the PATH environment variable. If needed, a custom path can be set here.
    Ignore Warnings: Suppress warnings for when the current external player does not support the current action (e.g. reversing playlists, etc.).
    Ignore Default Arguments: Do not send any default arguments to the external player aside from the video URL (e.g. playback rate, playlist URL, etc.). Custom arguments will still be passed on.
    Custom External Player Arguments: Any custom command line arguments you want to be passed on to the external player.
    DefaultCustomArgumentsTemplate: '(Default: ‘{defaultCustomArguments}’)'
  Experimental Settings:
    Replace HTTP Cache: Disables Electron's disk-based HTTP cache and enables a custom in-memory image cache. Will lead to increased RAM usage.
  Distraction Free Settings:
    Hide Channels: Enter a channel ID to hide all videos, playlists and the channel itself from appearing in search, trending, most popular and recommended. The channel ID entered must be a complete match and is case sensitive.
    Hide Subscriptions Live: This setting is overridden by the app-wide ‘{appWideSetting}’ setting, in the ‘{subsection}’ section of the ‘{settingsSection}’
    Hide Videos, Playlists and Channels Containing Text: Enter a word, word fragment, or phrase (case insensitive) to hide all videos and playlists whose original titles contain it throughout all of FreeTube, excluding only History, Your playlists, and videos inside of playlists.
    Hide Videos on Watch: Hides watched videos from the Videos, Shorts, and Live tabs on the Subscription and Channel pages. This does not affect the Home tab on Channel pages
  SponsorBlock Settings:
    UseDeArrowTitles: Replace video titles with user-submitted titles from DeArrow.
    UseDeArrowThumbnails: Replace video thumbnails with thumbnails from DeArrow.

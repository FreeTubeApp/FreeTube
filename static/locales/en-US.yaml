#Tooltips
Tooltips:
  General Settings:
    Preferred API Backend: Choose the backend that FreeTube uses to obtain data. The
      local API is a built-in extractor. The Invidious API requires an Invidious server
      to connect to.
    Fallback to Non-Preferred Backend on Failure: When your preferred API has a problem,
      FreeTube will automatically attempt to use your non-preferred API as a fallback
      method when enabled
    Thumbnail Preference: All thumbnails throughout FreeTube will be replaced with
      a frame of the video instead of the default thumbnail
    Invidious Instance: The Invidious instance that FreeTube will connect to for API
      calls. Clear the current instance to see a list of public instances to choose
      from
    Region for Trending: The region of trends allows you to pick which country's trending
      videos you want to have displayed. Not all countries displayed are actually
      supported by YouTube
  Player Settings:
    Force Local Backend for Legacy Formats: Only works when the Invidious API is your
      default. When enabled, the local API will run and use the legacy formats returned
      by that instead of the ones returned by Invidious. Helps when the videos returned
      by Invidious don't play due to country restrictions
    Proxy Videos Through Invidious: Will connect to Invidious to serve videos instead
      of making a direct connection to YouTube. Overrides API preference
    Default Video Format: Set the formats used when a video plays. Dash formats can
      play higher qualities. Legacy formats are limited to a max of 720p but use less
      bandwidth. Audio formats are audio only streams
  Subscription Settings:
    Fetch Feeds from RSS: When enabled, FreeTube will use RSS instead of it's default
      method for grabbing your subscription feed. RSS is faster and prevents IP blocking,
      but doesn't provide certain information like video duration or live status

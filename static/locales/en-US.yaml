#Tooltips
Tooltips:
  General Settings:
    Preferred API Backend: Choose the backend that FreeTube uses to obtain data. The
      local API is a built-in extractor. The Invidious API requires an Invidious server
      to connect to.
    Fallback to Non-Preferred Backend on Failure: When your preferred API has a problem,
      FreeTube will automatically attempt to use your non-preferred API as a fallback
      method when enabled.
    Thumbnail Preference: All thumbnails throughout FreeTube will be replaced with
      a frame of the video instead of the default thumbnail.
    Invidious Instance: The Invidious instance that FreeTube will connect to for API
      calls.
    Region for Trending: The region of trends allows you to pick which country's trending
      videos you want to have displayed. Not all countries displayed are actually
      supported by YouTube.
    External Link Handling: |
      Choose the default behavior when a link, which cannot be opened in FreeTube, is clicked.
      By default FreeTube will open the clicked link in your default browser.
  Player Settings:
    Force Local Backend for Legacy Formats: Only works when the Invidious API is your
      default. When enabled, the local API will run and use the legacy formats returned
      by that instead of the ones returned by Invidious. Helps when the videos returned
      by Invidious don't play due to country restrictions.
    Proxy Videos Through Invidious: Will connect to Invidious to serve videos instead
      of making a direct connection to YouTube. Overrides API preference.
    Default Video Format: Set the formats used when a video plays. DASH formats can
      play higher qualities. Legacy formats are limited to a max of 720p but use less
      bandwidth. Audio formats are audio only streams.
    Allow DASH AV1 formats: DASH AV1 formats may look better than DASH H.264 formats.
      DASH AV1 formats require more power to playback! They are not available on all videos,
      in those cases the player will use the DASH H.264 formats instead.
    Scroll Playback Rate Over Video Player: While the cursor is over the video, press and
      hold the Control key (Command Key on Mac) and scroll the mouse wheel forwards or backwards to control
      the playback rate. Press and hold the Control key (Command Key on Mac) and left click the mouse
      to quickly return to the default playback rate (1x unless it has been changed in the settings).
    Skip by Scrolling Over Video Player: Use the scroll wheel to skip through the video, MPV style.
  External Player Settings:
    External Player: Choosing an external player will display an icon, for opening the
      video (playlist if supported) in the external player, on the thumbnail. Warning, Invidious settings do not affect external players.
    Custom External Player Executable: By default, FreeTube will assume that the chosen external
      player can be found via the PATH environment variable. If needed, a custom path can
      be set here.
    Ignore Warnings: Suppress warnings for when the current external player does not support
      the current action (e.g. reversing playlists, etc.).
    Custom External Player Arguments: Any custom command line arguments, separated by semicolons (';'),
      you want to be passed to the external player.
    DefaultCustomArgumentsTemplate: "(Default: '{defaultCustomArguments}')"
  Distraction Free Settings:
    Hide Channels: Enter a channel name or channel ID to hide all videos, playlists and the channel itself from appearing in search or trending.
       The channel name entered must be a complete match and is case sensitive.
  Subscription Settings:
    Fetch Feeds from RSS: When enabled, FreeTube will use RSS instead of its default
      method for grabbing your subscription feed. RSS is faster and prevents IP blocking,
      but doesn't provide certain information like video duration or live status
    Fetch Automatically: When enabled, FreeTube will automatically fetch
      your subscription feed when a new window is opened and when switching profile.
  Privacy Settings:
    Remove Video Meta Files: When enabled, FreeTube automatically deletes meta files created during video playback,
      when the watch page is closed.
  Experimental Settings:
    Replace HTTP Cache: Disables Electron's disk based HTTP cache and enables a custom in-memory image cache. Will lead to increased RAM usage.

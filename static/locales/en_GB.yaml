Tooltips:
  Subscription Settings:
    Fetch Feeds from RSS: When enabled, FreeTube will use RSS instead of its default
      method to grab your subscription feed. RSS is faster and prevents IP blocking,
      but it doesn’t provide certain information like video duration, or live status
  Player Settings:
    Default Video Format: Set the formats used when a video plays. DASH formats can
      play higher qualities. Legacy formats are limited to a max of 720p but use less
      bandwidth. Audio formats are audio only streams.
    Proxy Videos Through Invidious: Will connect to Invidious to serve videos instead
      of making a direct connection to YouTube. Overrides API preference.
    Force Local Backend for Legacy Formats: Only works when the Invidious API is your
      default. When enabled, the local API will run and use the legacy formats returned
      by that instead of the ones returned by Invidious. Helps when the videos returned
      by Invidious don’t play due to country restrictions.
  General Settings:
    Region for Trending: The region of trends allows you to pick which country’s trending
      videos you want to have displayed. Not all countries displayed are actually
      supported by YouTube.
    Invidious Instance: The Invidious instance that FreeTube will connect to for API
      calls.
    Thumbnail Preference: All thumbnails throughout FreeTube will be replaced with
      a frame of the video instead of the default thumbnail.
    Fallback to Non-Preferred Backend on Failure: When your preferred API has a problem,
      FreeTube will automatically attempt to use your non-preferred API as a fallback
      method when enabled.
    Preferred API Backend: Choose the back-end that FreeTube uses to obtain data.
      The local API is a built-in extractor. The Invidious API requires an Invidious
      server to connect to.
    External Link Handling: "Choose the default behaviour when a link, which cannot\
      \ be opened in FreeTube, is clicked.\nBy default FreeTube will open the clicked\
      \ link in your default browser.\n"
  External Player Settings:
    External Player: Choosing an external player will display an icon, for opening
      the video (playlist if supported) in the external player, on the thumbnail.
    Custom External Player Executable: By default, FreeTube will assume that the chosen
      external player can be found via the PATH environment variable. If needed, a
      custom path can be set here.
    Ignore Warnings: Suppress warnings for when the current external player does not
      support the current action (e.g. reversing playlists, etc.).
    Custom External Player Arguments: Any custom command line arguments, separated
      by semicolons (';'), you want to be passed to the external player.
    # $ is replaced with the default custom arguments for the current player, if defined.
    DefaultCustomArgumentsTemplate: '(Default: ''$'')'
  Privacy Settings:
    Remove Video Meta Files: When enabled, FreeTube automatically deletes meta files
      created during video playback, when the watch page is closed.
Playing Next Video Interval: Playing next video in no time. Click to cancel. | Playing
  next video in {nextVideoInterval} second. Click to cancel. | Playing next video
  in {nextVideoInterval} seconds. Click to cancel.

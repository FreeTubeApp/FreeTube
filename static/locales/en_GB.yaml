  unavailability.
Tooltips:
  Subscription Settings:
    Fetch Feeds from RSS: When enabled, FreeTube will use RSS instead of its default
      method to grab your subscription feed. RSS is faster and prevents IP blocking,
      but it doesn’t provide certain information like video duration, or live status
    Fetch Automatically: When enabled, FreeTube will automatically fetch your subscription
      feed when a new window is opened and when switching profile.
  Player Settings:
    Default Video Format: Set the formats used when a video plays. DASH formats can
      play higher qualities. Legacy formats are limited to a max of 720p but use less
      bandwidth. Audio formats are audio only streams.
    Proxy Videos Through Invidious: Will connect to Invidious to serve videos instead
      of making a direct connection to YouTube. Overrides API preference.
    Force Local Backend for Legacy Formats: Only works when the Invidious API is your
      default. When enabled, the local API will run and use the legacy formats returned
      by that instead of the ones returned by Invidious. Helps when the videos returned
      by Invidious don’t play due to country restrictions.
    Scroll Playback Rate Over Video Player: While the cursor is over the video, press
      and hold the Control key (Command Key on Mac) and scroll the mouse wheel forwards
      or backwards to control the playback rate. Press and hold the Control key (Command
      Key on Mac) and left click the mouse to quickly return to the default playback
      rate (1x unless it has been changed in the settings).
    Skip by Scrolling Over Video Player: Use the scroll wheel to skip through the
      video, MPV style.
  General Settings:
    Region for Trending: The region of trends allows you to pick which country’s trending
      videos you want to have displayed. Not all countries displayed are actually
      supported by YouTube.
    Invidious Instance: The Invidious instance that FreeTube will connect to for API
      calls.
    Thumbnail Preference: All thumbnails throughout FreeTube will be replaced with
      a frame of the video instead of the default thumbnail.
    Fallback to Non-Preferred Backend on Failure: When your preferred API has a problem,
      FreeTube will automatically attempt to use your non-preferred API as a fallback
      method when enabled.
    Preferred API Backend: Choose the back-end that FreeTube uses to obtain data.
      The local API is a built-in extractor. The Invidious API requires an Invidious
      server to connect to.
    External Link Handling: "Choose the default behaviour when a link, which cannot\
      \ be opened in FreeTube, is clicked.\nBy default FreeTube will open the clicked\
      \ link in your default browser.\n"
  External Player Settings:
    External Player: Choosing an external player will display an icon, for opening
      the video (playlist if supported) in the external player, on the thumbnail.
      Warning, Invidious settings do not affect external players.
    Custom External Player Executable: By default, FreeTube will assume that the chosen
      external player can be found via the PATH environment variable. If needed, a
      custom path can be set here.
    Ignore Warnings: Suppress warnings for when the current external player does not
      support the current action (e.g. reversing playlists, etc.).
    Custom External Player Arguments: Any custom command line arguments, separated
      by semicolons (';'), you want to be passed to the external player.
    DefaultCustomArgumentsTemplate: '(Default: ‘{defaultCustomArguments}’)'
  Privacy Settings:
    Remove Video Meta Files: When enabled, FreeTube automatically deletes meta files
      created during video playback, when the watch page is closed.
  Experimental Settings:
    Replace HTTP Cache: Disables Electron's disk-based HTTP cache and enables a custom
      in-memory image cache. Will lead to increased RAM usage.
  Distraction Free Settings:
    Hide Channels: Enter a channel name or channel ID to hide all videos, playlists
      and the channel itself from appearing in search or trending. The channel name
      entered must be a complete match and is case sensitive.
Playing Next Video Interval: Playing next video in no time. Click to cancel. | Playing
  next video in {nextVideoInterval} second. Click to cancel. | Playing next video
  in {nextVideoInterval} seconds. Click to cancel.

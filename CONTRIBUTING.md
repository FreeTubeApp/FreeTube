# Code Contributions

Please follow these guidlines before sending your pull request and making contributions.

* When you submit a pull request, you agree that your code is published under the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)
* Do not include non-free software or modules with your code.
* Make sure your pull request is setup to merge your branch to FreeTube's development branch.
* Make sure your branch is up to date with the development branch before submitting your pull request.
* Stick to a similar style of code already in the project.  Please look at current code to get an idea on how to do this.
* Follow [ES6](http://es6-features.org/) standards in your code. Ex: Use `let` and `const` instead of `var`. Do not use `function(response){//code}` for callbacks, use `(response) => {//code}`.
* Comment your code when necessary.  Follow the [JavaScript Documentation and Comments Standard](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/javascript/javascript-api-documentation-and-comment-standards) for functions.
* Please test your code.  Make sure new features work as well as core features such as watching videos or loading subscriptions.
* Please limit the amount of Node Modules that you introduce into the project.  Only include them when absolutely necessary for your code to work (Ex: Using nedb for databases) or if a module provides similar functionality to what you are trying to achieve (Ex: Using autolinker to create links to outside URLs instead of writing the functionality myself).
* Please try to stay involved with the community and maintain your code.  I am only one person and I work on FreeTube only in my spare time.  I do not have time to work on everything and it would be nice if you can maintain your code when necessary.

# Code Contribution Guidelines
Thank you for your interest in contributing to FreeTube! To ensure a smooth development process and maintain high-quality standards, please follow the guidelines below when contributing features, bug fixes, or documentation updates.

## Before You Start Coding
To promote collaboration and avoid duplicate efforts, please follow these steps before beginning your work:

Working on an Existing Issue:
If you're addressing an issue that's already been reported, leave a comment on the issue stating your intention to work on it. This helps us coordinate tasks and avoid duplication.

Working on a New Feature:
If your contribution is not tied to an existing issue, please create a new issue first. This allows the community to discuss the feature before any code is written.

Major Feature Contributions:
For large features, be prepared to support and maintain your code in the future (e.g., fixing bugs or resolving merge conflicts).
Optionally, you can join our Matrix channel for real-time communication and updates about ongoing work.

## Before Submitting a Pull Request
When your code is ready for review, make sure it meets the following requirements:

## License Agreement:
By submitting a pull request (PR), you agree that your code will be published under the GNU Affero General Public License.

## Link to Issues:
Reference any related issue(s) in your pull request to provide context and background.

Open Source Compliance:
Do not include any non-free software or proprietary modules.

Target the Right Branch:
Ensure your PR is set to merge into the development branch of FreeTube.

Stay Up-to-Date:
Sync your feature/bugfix branch with the latest development branch before submitting.

## Code Style & Standards:

Follow the style and structure used throughout the existing codebase.

Write ES6-compliant JavaScript (e.g., use let and const instead of var, use arrow functions like (response) => {} instead of anonymous function expressions).

Add meaningful comments where appropriate. Use the JavaScript Documentation and Comment Standards.

Maintain a clean and modular Vue.js structure. Use the Vue.js Guide as a reference, and follow patterns already used in the project.

## Functionality & Testing:

Test your code thoroughly before submitting.

Ensure your feature works with both the Local API and the Invidious API.

Core functionality (e.g., watching videos, loading subscriptions) should remain stable.

Linting:
Your code must pass lint checks. Use:

*bash
*Copy code
*npm run lint       # Check for issues
*npm run lint-fix   # Auto-fix where possible
*Minimize Dependencies:
*Only add Node modules if absolutely necessary. Use a new module if:

Itâ€™s essential for your feature to work (e.g., nedb for databases).

It avoids reinventing the wheel (e.g., autolinker for link parsing).

Stay Involved:
Please remain engaged with the community and help maintain your contributions over time. FreeTube is developed by a small group of volunteers, and your continued support helps the project grow sustainably.

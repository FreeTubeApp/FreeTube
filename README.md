FreeTube is an open source desktop YouTube player built with privacy in mind.
Use YouTube without advertisements and prevent Google tracking from you with their cookies and JavaScript.
Available for Windows, Mac & Linux thanks to Electron.

Please note that FreeTube is currently in Beta. While it should work well for
most users, there are still bugs and missing features that need to be
addressed.

[Download FreeTube](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube/releases)

### Browser Extension

Download our browser extension so that you can click on videos in your browser and have them automatically open up in FreeTube.

[Download for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/freetube-redirect/)

[Instructions for Google Chrome](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube/wiki/Browser-Extension)

## How does it work?
FreeTube uses the [Invidious API](https://github.com/omarroth/invidious) to grab and serve videos.  Invidious scrapes the YouTube site which prevents the need for any official YouTube API.  While YouTube can still see your video requests, it can no
longer track you using cookies or JavaScript. Your subscriptions, history, and
saved videos are stored locally on your computer and never sent out.  Using a VPN or Tor is recommended
to hide your IP while using FreeTube.

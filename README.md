FreeTube is an open source desktop YouTube player built with privacy in mind.
Use YouTube without advertisments and Google tracking you using cookies and JavaScript.
Available for Windows, Mac & Linux thanks to Electron.

Please note that FreeTube is currently in Beta. While it should work well for
most users, there are still bugs and missing features that need to be
addressed.

## How does it work?
FreeTube uses the proprietary [YouTube HTTP
API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) with a set of
hard coded API keys.  Videos are resolved using
[youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/)
 and played using the stock HTML5 video
player.  While YouTube can still see your API and video requests it can no
longer track you using cookies or JavaScript. Your subscriptions, history, and
saved videos are stored locally on your computer and never sent out.

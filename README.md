# How Does It Work?
FreeTube uses the YouTube API to search for videos.  It then uses the youtube-dl API to grab the raw video files and play them in a basic HTML5 video player, preventing YouTube from tracking you using cookies or JavaScript.  Subscriptions, history, and saved videos are stored locally on the user's computer and is never sent out to Google or anyone else.  You own your data.

## Features
* Watch videos free of ads
* Prevent Google from tracking what you watch using cookies or JavaScript
* Subscribe to channels without an account
* Store subscriptions, history, and saved videos locally
* Import / Backup subscriptions
* Mini Player
* Light / Dark Theme

# FreeTube is Currently in Beta
While I believe that FreeTube should work well for most users, there will probably be some bugs or features missing.  Because of this, FreeTube is currently in beta and will be considered "stable" when these have been addressed.

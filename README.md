**Copylefted libre software desktop YouTube player** (with privacy).

No advertisements or local Google claws tracking you with cookies and JavaScript.

Available for Linux, Windows and macOS thanks to Electron.

Should work for most users, but there are still bugs and missing features.

[Download](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube/releases)

### Browser Extension

FreeTube is supported by the [Privacy Redirect](https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect), on [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-redirect/) or [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-redirect/pmcmeagblkinmogikoikkdjiligflglb), \
which allows you to open YouTube links into FreeTube from your web browser. \
Turn it on from the advanced settings in the extention.

Only report issues getting FreeTube to work with the extension here.

## How does it work?
A built in extractor or the [Invidious API](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) is used to grab and serve data/videos. \
FreeTube does not use any official APIs to obtain data. \
YouTube can still see your video requests, but can no longer track you using cookies or JavaScript. \
Your subscriptions and history are stored locally on your computer and never sent out. \
Using a VPN or Tor is highly recommended to hide your IP while using FreeTube.

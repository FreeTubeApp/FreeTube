# Design Tweaks

The same [FreeTube](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube) you know & love, but with **edgy design tweaks** that won't necesarily become part of the official version because functionally some things will suck. Keep in mind that **I don't have a lot of time to fix things quickly** and that it's not completely stable.

## Known Bugs (let me know about yours)

* Left side items look weird on hover
* The video player menus look out of place and are not rounded
* Some buttons in the top left corner are not shown
* Not good for accesibility, since this version is focusing on design

## Installation

A. [Download the latest appimage](https://github.com/dragosnfy/FreeTube/releases) (make sure that ```allow executing file as program``` is checked when you right click on it)

B. Build it on your own with ```npm install```, ```npm run build``` or ```npm run dev``` (which means you need to install nodejs & npm)

## Wanna contribute?

* You can support the [original FreeTube project here](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube), [donate](https://liberapay.com/FreeTube) or join the [Matrix Community](https://matrix.to/#/+freetube:matrix.org)
* To help this repo specifically, feel free to add your own suggestions or ask things, I'm open, but I don't promise I will include everything, because I don't wanna deviate too much from the original project in terms of functionality. However if it's related to design & it respects ui/ux rules, then we can go wild as long as it looks good! Oh and try adding screenshots when you suggest things!
